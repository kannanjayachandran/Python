"""
 The python Standard Library is a  collection of files that contains additional built-in
 functionalities. we have to import them as modules in order to access their functionalities.
 Pythonâ€™s standard library is very extensive; that contains built-in modules (written in C) that
 provide access to system functionality such as file I/O that would otherwise be inaccessible to
 Python programmers, as well as modules written in Python that provide standardized solutions for
 many problems that occur in everyday programming...
